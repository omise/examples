# Spree Ecommerce Demo with Omise

This a Spree Rails application using Omise ActiveMerchant gateway plugin.

Tested with Spree Stable and ActiveMerchant 1.47.0, which uses our Omise branch: [omise-1.47.0](https://github.com/omise/active_merchant/tree/omise-1.47.0) 

Support in mainstream ActiveMerchant is currently under Pull Request review.

## Instructions

### Features

1. Create a token using Omise.js and charge the card using token.
2. Use token to save customer on database and charge the card anytime (Spree Card Profile)
3. Full or Partial Refunds

### Setup

If you already have a Spree store, just add the following to Gemfile

```ruby
# For spree version 3.0.0
gem 'activemerchant', github: 'omise/active_merchant', branch: 'omise-1.47.0'
gem 'spree-omise', github: 'omise/spree-omise'
```

To start with a fresh store:

```
git clone git@github.com:omise/spree_demo.git
cd spree_demo
bundle install
cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml
bundle exec rake db:create
bin/rake railties:install:migrations
bin/rake db:migrate
bin/rake db:seed
bin/rake spree_sample:load
bin/rake secret
```
copy the output from `bin/rake secret` command
and set it as a value of `secret_key_base` key in config/secrets.yml for a running environment
